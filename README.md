# BMI-Calculator
What is it?

The BMI, or the Body Mass Index, calculator processes the input of both the height and weight in either metric or imperial measurements and applies such through the BMI formula to yield the BMI of a person with the certain height and weight. 

Metric BMI = weight / (height^2)
Imperial BMI = 703 * (weight / (height^2))

The major drawback with the BMI calculator, however, is the failure to consider athleticism and bodybuilding which may skew the results of the BMI calculator to lead to false readings.

Design Elements

I was inspired by the Frutiger Aero, late 2000s early 2010s aesthetics of the websites that I used to visit back in my childhood and thus used that inspiration to design this web application. Blue appeared to be fitting for the BMI calculator however as long as the main design stayed relatively the same, any proper match of colors would do.
