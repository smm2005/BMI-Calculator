# BMI-Calculator
What is it?

The BMI, or the Body Mass Index, calculator processes the input of both the height and weight in either metric or imperial measurements and applies such through the BMI formula to yield the BMI of a person with the certain height and weight. The major drawback with the BMI calculator, however, is the failure to consider athleticism and bodybuilding which may skew the results of the BMI calculator to lead to false readings.
